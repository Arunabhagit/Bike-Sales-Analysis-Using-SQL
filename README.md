2. **CRUD Operation** : Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS** : Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

# Project Setup 

**ERD Model** 

An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a visual representation of a database's structure, illustrating entities (tables), their attributes (columns), and relationships (connections) between them. It helps design, understand, and optimize databases by mapping how data is organized and related, ensuring efficient database management and querying.
